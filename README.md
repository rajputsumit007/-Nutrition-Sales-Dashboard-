🚀Nutrition Sales Dashboard using Tableau
Over the past few days, I worked on a data visualization project to improve my analytical and dashboard-building skills. Here's a quick breakdown of what I did:
🔍 Sourced a raw dataset from Kaggle:
 • Removed duplicates
 • Fixed formatting and structural errors
 • Performed data manipulation and transformation for better insights
📊 Tool Used: Tableau
 • Built a fully interactive and dynamic dashboard
 • Focused on key metrics like product types, nutritional values, pricing trends, and brand comparisons
 • Incorporated filters, charts, KPIs, and color-coded insights to make the dashboard user-friendly and insightful
💡 What I Learned:
 • Improved my data cleaning and preprocessing skills
 • Gained hands-on experience in creating meaningful visualizations
 • Learned how to design dashboards that are both visually appealing and informative
📚 What’s Next:
 I'm now aiming to:
 ✅ Deepen my skills in advanced Tableau visualizations (like calculated fields, LOD expressions, parameters)
 ✅ Explore Power BI to broaden my data visualization toolset
Proud of this small milestone and excited to continue my journey in data analytics! 🚀
